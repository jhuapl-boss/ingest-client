## 0.9.5

### Fixed Bug:

* The try-catch in Engine.run() was just around the ingest clientâ€™s IO to S3, but user developed plugins can be doing IO to anything and have random, transient errors as well. Moved the try statement to the top of the loop.

* Fixed error that printed the wrong tile count estimates when the Ingest Job extents contained an offset
